# student-api
Creating a Web API - PHP

Create a Student Grade Management API. The API should allow students to be added with their exam scores, and it should calculate their final grade and determine if they have passed.  

-- Grade Calculation: The final grade is calculated as:
-- Final Grade=(0.4×Midterm Score)+(0.6×Final Score)
-- A student passes if their Final Grade is 75 or higher. Otherwise, they fail.

API Endpoints
-- Add a Student (with scores)
-- Retrieve all students (with their grades and pass/fail status)
-- Update a student's scores
-- Delete a student
-- Get a single student's final grade and status
-- Get all student final grade and status /* gi usa ra nako */
